Dart Printing and String Interpolation
---------------------------------------

The print() function is used to print output on the console, and $expression is used for the string interpolation. Below is an example.

Example :
---------

void main()  
{  
    var name = "Peter";  
    var roll_no = 24;  
    print("My name is ${name} My roll number is ${roll_no}");  
}  


Output :
--------
My name is Peter My roll number is 24

Dart Data Types
.................................................................................................................................................................................

Dart supports the following built-in Data types.

Number
Strings
Boolean
Lists
Maps
Runes
Symbols


Dart Number
-----------
The Darts Number is used to store the numeric values. The number can be two types - integer and double.
int marks = 80;
double pi = 3.14;


Dart Strings
------------
A string is the sequence of the character. If we store the data like - name, address, special character, etc. It is signified by using either single quotes or double quotes. A Dart string is a sequence of UTF-16 code units.
var msg = "Hi";

Dart Boolean
-------------
The Boolean type represents the two values - true and false. The bool keyword uses to denote Boolean Type. The numeric values 1 and 0 cannot be used to represent the true or false value.
bool isValid = true;


Dart Lists
------------
In Dart, The list is a collection of the ordered objects (value). The concept of list is similar to an array. An array is defined as a collection of the multiple elements in a single variable. The elements in the list are separated by the comma enclosed in the square bracket[]. The sample list is given below.
var list = [1,2,3]

Dart Maps
----------
The maps type is used to store values in key-value pairs. Each key is associated with its value. The key and value can be any type. In Map, the key must be unique, but a value can occur multiple times. The Map is defined by using curly braces ({}), and comma separates each pair.
var student = {'name': 'Joseph',  'age':25, 'Branch': 'Computer Science'}  


Dart Runes
-----------
As we know that, the strings are the sequence of Unicode UTF-16 code units. Unicode is a technique which is used to describe a unique numeric value for each digit, letter, and symbol. Since Dart Runes are the special string of Unicode UTF-32 units. It is used to represent the special syntax.

For example - The special heart character â™¥ is equivalent to Unicode code \u2665, where \u means Unicode, and the numbers are hexadecimal integer. If the hex value is less or greater than 4 digits, it places in a curly bracket ({}). For example - An emoji ðŸ˜€ is represented as \u{1f600}. The example is given below.

Example -

void main(){  
    var heart_symbol = '\u2665';  
    var laugh_symbol = '\u{1f600}';  
    print(heart_symbol);  
    print(laugh_symbol);  
}  


Output:

â™¥
ðŸ˜€
